This is another version of my portfolio built with React and Materialze. I learned some new concepts for this project including how to use multiple components, import styles from Materialize, include breakpoints using terinary statements, import icons from Fontawesome, and use react-router. This portfolio includes links to relevant projects, Github, and LinkedIn. It also includes my bio, my brand statement, and a list of technologies that I am familiar with. Tip of the hat to coding champion, Leland Shirley for helping me with this!
